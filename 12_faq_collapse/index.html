        <h3>What is an API?</h3>
        <div class="btn"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <p>
          At the very least, offer your interviewer a brief description of what API is but you can also expand the
          answer
          to
          include an example of a time that you’ve previously used it.
        </p>
        <p class="example">Example: “An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software that allows two
          applications to communicate with
          each
          other.”</p>
      </div>

        <h3>What are some styles for creating a Web API?</h3>
        <div class="btn"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <p>
          To really stand out, do more than just answer the question. Include your preference or a story about a time
          when
          you used a specific architectural style.
        </p>
        <p class="example">Example: “Common Web API architectural styles are XML/JSON as a formatting language,
          stateless communication, basic
          URI as the address for the services and HTTP for communication between the client and server. Personally, I
          prefer XML over JSON.”</p>

        <h3>What is API testing?</h3>
        <div class="btn"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <p>
          If an interviewer asks you this question, they may be looking to determine if you can adequately articulate
          your
          response. Provide a clear definition as well as some examples.
        </p>
        <p class="example">Example: “API testing is a type of software testing that determines if the developed APIs
          are functional, reliable and
          secure. Some of the common API testing types are validation, security, UI, functional, load, penetration,
          runtime/error detection, fuzz and interoperability and WS Compliance.”</p>

        <h3>What are the advantages of API Testing?</h3>
        <div class="btn"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <p>
          Make sure that your answer reflects a thorough comprehension of the advantages of API testing. You should
          show
          the interviewer that you know how and when to use it in your work.
        </p>
        <p class="example">Example: “API testing gives access to the application without needing a user interface.
          This
          allows you to detect the
          minor issues before they become big problems during GUI testing.

          Also, API testing is typically less time consuming than GUI testing because it uses less code. As a result,
          it
          offers a more effective and efficient test coverage.

          Another benefit is that the data is transferred using XML or JSON. These modes of exchange are
          language-independent, allowing users to select any coding language when choosing automation testing
          services.
          Additionally, API
          testing is easily integrated with GUI testing.”</p>

        <h3>What is the procedure for performing API testing?</h3>
        <div class="btn"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <p>
          Show the interviewer the steps you would take when performing API testing. You’re proving that you actually
          know what you’re talking about, so take your time and be sure to list each action.
        </p>
        <p class="example">Example: “When performing API testing, you’ll first choose the suite where you’d like to
          add
          the API case that you
          wish
          to test, then you choose the test development mode. After that, you create test cases for the desired API
          methods,
          configure the control parameters and test conditions of the application as well as the method of validation.
          Then you
          can perform the API test. Once the test is complete, you check the test reports, filter and sequence all of
          the
          API
          test
          cases.”</p>
